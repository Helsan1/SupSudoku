# SupSudoku 

What is SupSudoku?
=============

SupSudoku	is	a	logic-based	game.	The	objective	is	to	fill	a	9×9	grid	with	digits	so	that	each	column,	each	row,	and	each	of	the	nine	3×3	sub-grids	that	compose	the	grid contains	all	of	the	digits	from	1	to	9. The	puzzle	setter	provides	a	partially	completed	grid,	which	for	a	well-posed	puzzle	has	a	unique	solution.	Completed	puzzles	are	always	a	type	of	Latin	square	with	an	additional	constraint	on	the	contents	of	individual	regions. For	example,	the	same	single	integer	may	not	appear	twice	in	the	same	row,	column	or	in	any	of	the	nine	3×3	subregions	of	the	9x9	playing	board.
